Okay, here's a draft of the first message you can send to both your architecture (Exchange messaging specialists) and L2 support teams. It's designed to be positive, introduce the new communication initiative, and get them excited about participating:
Subject: Improving Collaboration: Architecture and L2 Teams Working Together!
Hi everyone,
As our Exchange environment continues to grow and evolve, it's more important than ever that our Architecture and L2 Support teams work together seamlessly. We've heard your feedback, and we recognize that there's room to improve communication and collaboration between our teams.
To address this, we're excited to launch a new initiative focused on strengthening the connection between Architecture and L2.  We'll be holding short, focused 15-minute meetings on a regular basis [e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday at 10:00 AM - adjust as needed].
What are these meetings about?
These meetings are designed to:
 * Share Knowledge:  Bridge the gap between L2 troubleshooting and the underlying architecture of our Exchange systems.
 * Improve Escalations:  Make the escalation process smoother and more efficient.
 * Address Pain Points:  Tackle common issues and challenges that both teams face.
 * Build Relationships: Get to know each other better and foster a more collaborative environment.
Each 15-minute session will have a single, specific topic. For example, we might cover:
 * "Troubleshooting Mail Flow: Essential Information for L2"
 * "Understanding Database Availability Groups (DAGs): A Quick Overview"
 * "New Feature X in Exchange: How It Impacts Support"
 * "Demo: Using command X to gather information about Y"
Why this approach?
We believe that frequent, focused discussions are the best way to share knowledge effectively without taking up too much of your valuable time.  These meetings will be interactive, with opportunities to ask questions and share your expertise.
Your input is crucial!
Before we kick things off, we want to hear from you.  Please take a few minutes to fill out this short survey: [Link to Survey - see example questions below]. Your feedback will help us identify the most important topics to cover in our initial meetings.
Next Steps:
 * Fill out the survey by [Survey Deadline].
 * Look out for a calendar invite for our first 15-minute meeting on [Date of First Meeting].
We're confident that this initiative will make a real difference in how we work together. We look forward to your participation and building a stronger, more collaborative team!
Best regards,

Example Survey Questions:
 * What are the biggest communication challenges you currently experience between the L2 and Architecture teams?
 * What specific Exchange topics would you like to learn more about in these 15-minute meetings?
 * What information do you wish you had when handling Exchange-related support cases?
 * What are your suggestions for improving the escalation process?
 * Do you have any other feedback or ideas to share?
Important Considerations:
 * Keep it positive and enthusiastic:  The tone of the message should be upbeat and encouraging.
 * Highlight the benefits:  Emphasize how this initiative will make their jobs easier and improve their skills.
 * Make it easy to participate: Provide a clear call to action (the survey) and keep it short and to the point.
 * Set expectations: Clearly state the purpose of the meetings and the expected format.
 * Follow up:  After sending the message, make sure to follow up with the survey results and the first meeting invitation.
This initial message, along with the survey, will help you set the stage for a successful communication initiative. Good luck!
